## Express.js backend server for the Exchange Rate Dashboard App

Tech stack: Express.js, MongoDB

Deployed backend server on Render: https://dashboard-exchange-rates-be.onrender.com/api/exchange-rate-data

The server will be deployed to cloud, but if you want to run it locally, clone this git repo to your machine, run `npm install`.
Then run `npm run start` to start the backend server on PORT 8000 of localhost (http://localhost:8000/api/exchange-rate-data).
Then replace any API call URLs from the front-end with http://localhost:8000/api/exchange-rate-data
